<H3> <i>It's Lit. </i> </H3>

<strong>Life as a transfer student can be rough at times:</strong>
<ol> 
	<li>Having to figure out the bus routes</li> 
	<li>Walking a mile to a building, 
	only to realize it's the wrong class</li>
	<li>Begging freshman for swipes</li>
</ol>

  <p><a href="www.txstate.edu">Texas State</a> is where I go to school.</p>

<p>
When you're brand new to a school, life is challenging, but still very fun. 
I transfered to Texas State before the fall semester of 2016. 
I went to a junior college before TXST, and I basically ran out of classes.
I had to move down here mostly because I had run out of classes at my junior college.
</p>
<p>
Originally, I wanted to pursue a career in sports journalism. 
Upon further research, I realized that I would rather do something with computers and integrated technology.
Lucky for me, Texas State was adding a brand new <a href="http://www.masscomm.txstate.edu/degrees-programs/digital-media-innovation.html">Digital Media major!</a>
I decided to change my major, and I've loved it ever since.
</p>
<p>
I'd have to say that my dream job would either be to work for <a href="https://gopro.com">GoPro</a> or an electronics company like Samsung or LG. 
If none of those work out, I would be content with finding a job in either the Social Media or Web Design field.
My only request is that I stay in the Central Texas area, because this is my home!
